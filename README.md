# The Matrix-syntax theme

This theme is based off the matrix theme from cloudsagemath.  This is the first syntax theme that I have made and I now want to share it with the rest of the atom users.

As you can see from the above picture I am a fan of the web show RvB and have labeled my colours accordingly.

This is what a typical screen would look like with this syntax theme enabled.

As this is the first theme that I have done I would welcome any changes that you think would be cool/make it better, simply fork the repository and submit a pull request for evaluation. :smiling_imp:

Happy Coding! :shipit: :+1:
