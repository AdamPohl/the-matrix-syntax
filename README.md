# The Matrix - a syntax theme

This theme is based off the matrix theme from cloudsagemath.  This is the first syntax theme that
I have made and I now want to share it with the rest of the atom users.


As you can see from the picture below I am a fan of the web show RvB and have labeled my colours
accordingly.

Below is what a typical screen would look like with me this syntax theme enabled.

As this is the first theme that I have done, I welcome any changes that you think would make the
theme cooler/more efficient.  Simply fork the repository and submit a pull request for
evaluation. :smiling_imp:

Happy Coding! :shipit: :+1:
